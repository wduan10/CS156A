    "First, we set up the points in a circle, as this configuration maximizes the number of dichotomies. We note that a triangle easily classifies +1s when they are close together, and starts to struggle when the +1s are separated by -1s inbetween. Since a triangle has three points, it is able to classify 3 separated groups of +1s. If the number of separated groups of +1s is 4 or more, the hypothesis no longer shatters the points. It is only possible to generate 4 separated groups of +1s if you also use at least 4 -1s to separate the +1s. This means 8 is a breaking point, since you can construct the circle with alternating +1s and -1s to create 4 separated groups of +1s. It is possible to shatter 7 because the most amount of separated groups of +1s that can be created is 3 (there are not enough -1s to create 4 separated groups of +1s). Therefore, the answer is **d)**."

In other words, if r is between a and b, it is classified as +1, and classified as -1 otherwise. This method of classifying is synonymous to the 1-interval hypothesis. There are $N + 1 \\choose 2$ ways to construct one interval with non-negative length, as you have $N + 1$ places to put a left and right bound on the interval (synonymous to choosing a and b). There is 1 way to construct no interval (synonymous to setting a = b), leaving all the points to be classified as -1.
